# SynCord

SynCord is a framework to modify kernel locks without recompiling or rebooting the kernel.
It abstracts key behaviors of kernel locks and exposes them as APIs for designing user-defined kernel locks.
SynCord provides the mechanisms to customize kernel locks safely and correctly from userspace.

The source code is publicly available at the [Github repository](https://github.com/rs3lab/SynCord).

SynCord and its associated paper will be presented at the Proceedings of the 16th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation 2022 (OSDI '22).
