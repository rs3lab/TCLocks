## Building

`make`

### Dependencies

- numactl
- coreutils
- make
- gcc
- git

## Execution

Launch your application using one of the provided scripts.
The name of the script to you use depends on the chosen lock.

Examples:

 * If you want to use the MCS lock with the spin-then-park policy, do the following: `./libmcs_spin_then_park.sh my_program`

 * For the CLH lock with the spin policy, do the following: `./libclh_spinlock.sh my_program`

 * For the ticket lock (which has its waiting policy hardcoded - see below), do the following: `./libticket_original.sh my_program`

## Details

### Usage
The algorithms are named according to the following schema: `lib{algo}_{waiting_policy}.sh`.

The waiting policy can either be spinlock, spin_then_park or original.

Some algorithms come with different waiting policies (Malthusian, MCS, C-BO-MCS, CLH).
For example, if you want to execute your application with the MCS lock, using a spin-then-park waiting policy,
use `libmcs_spinlock.sh`.

For the other algorithms, the name of the script to use is of the form `lib{algo}_original.sh`.
In this case, the waiting policy depends on the one used in the original design of the corresponding lock (spin in most cases).

The library uses `LD_PRELOAD` to intercept calls to most of the `pthread_mutex_*` functions.

### Support for condition variables

#### Summary of the approach

As explained in [LOC], we rely on classic Pthread condition variables to implement condition variables.
Here is some pseudo-code to summarize the approach:
```C
// return values and error checks
// omitted for simplification

pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *m) {
    optimized_mutex_t *om;
    om = get_optimized_mutex(m);
    if (om == null) {
        om = create_and_store_optim_mutex(m);
    }
    optimized_mutex_lock(om);
    real_pthread_mutex_lock(m);
}

pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *m) {
    optimized_mutex_t *om;
    om = get_optimized_mutex(m);
    optimized_mutex_unlock(om);
    real_pthread_mutex_unlock(m);
}

pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *c,
                  pthread_mutex_t *m) {
    optimized_mutex_t *om;
    om = get_optimized_mutex(m);
    optimized_mutex_unlock(om);
    real_pthread_cond_wait(c, m);
    real_pthread_mutex_unlock(m);
    optimized_mutex_lock(om);
    real_pthread_mutex_lock(m);
}

// Note that the pthread_cond_signal and
// pthread_cond_broadcast primitives
// do not need to be interposed
```

This strategy does not introduce contention on the Pthread lock, as the latter is only requested by the holder of
the optimized lock associated with the critical section.

Some people have raised concerns about the possibility that several threads contended on the Pthread lock, especially for
workloads using `pthread_cond_broadcast`.
However, on Glibc/Linux, `pthread_cond_broadcast` is implemented (via the `futex` syscall) in a way such that it does not
wake up several threads at the same time. Indeed, according to the source code of the `pthread_cond_broadcast`
implementation, the broadcast function simply wakes up a single thread from the wait queue of the condition variable
and transfers the remaining threads to the wait queue of the Pthread lock. This is also confirmed in the `futex(2)` man page.
So, overall, for workloads that use `pthread_cond_broadcast` and/or `pthread_cond_signal`, it is unlikely to have more than
two threads contending for the Pthread lock at the same time.

#### Disabling support for condition variables

By default, the locks are built with the above-described support for condition variables.
However, if you know that the target application does not use condition variables, you can build the locks without it.
This allows optimizing the critical path for lock acquisition/release by removing the need to acquire/release the underlying Pthread lock.
To do so, use `make no_cond_var`.


### Trylock primitives

#### Implementation
Some algorithms do not come officially with a trylock primitive (i.e., non blocking lock request).
Here is how we implemented trylock for them :

- Cohorting: first trylock the local lock, and if needed trylock the top lock. If acquiring the top lock fails, unlock the local lock.
- HMCS: same idea as the one for the cohorting locks
- HYS-HMCS: as the algorithm supports fast-path, we only trylock the root MCS lock.
- Malthusian: just trylock like with a classical MCS lock.
- Ticket lock: the grant and request tickets are two 32-bit consecutive integers that are considered as a single 64-bit integer when trylocking.
- Partitioned Ticket: we cannot use the trick of the ticket lock because there are only 64-bit atomic ops and we have an array of tickets. So we first check if there is anybody waiting for the lock and if not, we try to lock (we may wait a little if threads come between the check and the acquisition).

#### Unsupported locks
To the best of our knowledge, the design of these algorithms does not support trylock semantics:

- CLH and CLH-EPFL
- HTLOCK-EPFL


### Adding a new lock

The library is designed to be extensible. In order to introduce a new lock algorithm, consider the following steps:

1. Edit Makefile.config: add one line with the format `algo_waitingstrategy` (`algo` without spaces in lowercase, `waitingstrategy` is `original`, `spinlock` or `spin_then_park`)
2. Add a file `include/algo.h`: take `spinlock` as an example
3. Add a file `src/algo.c`: take `spinlock` as an example
4. Modify the top of the `interpose.c` file to add a `#ifdef` for your algorithm (the Makefile takes care of everything)

Remarks:

- Several helper functions are available in `src/utils.c` and `src/utils.h`.
- If each thread needs its context for a lock, see `include/mcs.h` (`#define NEED_CONTEXT 1` is important)
- If you want to automatically support different waiting policies, use `#define SUPPORT_WAITING 1` and `waiting_policy_{sleep/wake}`. Look into `src/mcs.c` for an example.
- There is an example of a non-lock (`src/concurrency.c`) to show a case where the library can be used for logging statistics about locks (instead of replacing the original lock algorithm).

### Cascading interposition libraries

You may want to capture statistics for different locks. For example, if you want to capture the concurrency of the MCS algorithm, you can do the following:

`./libconcurrency_original.sh ./libmcs_spinlock.sh my_program`

#### Details
In order to be able to chain interposition libraries, we must add versions to the symbols we export.
This is done using a symbol map (see `src/interpose.map`) and by adding a `symver` asm symbol after the function declaration (see `src/interpose.c`).
Without that, the library is not able to get the function pointer address of the next function using `dlvsym`.

LiTL also uses the [CLHT](https://github.com/LPD-EPFL/CLHT) hashtable.
This hashtable is used to link a pthread_mutex_lock with the underlying data structure of the interposed lock (e.g., MCS).
