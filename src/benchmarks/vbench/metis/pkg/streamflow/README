Notes
---

Compiling:
	- In the Makefile, define a META_METHOD as one of HEADERS,
	  BIBOP or RADIX_TREE. All architectures support HEADERS. Only 
	  32-bit architectures support BIBOP, and only 64-bit architectures
	  support RADIX_TREE.
	- In the Makefile, define ASM as x86, ppc64 or ia64. These are the 
	  only supported architectures at this time. Adding additional 
	  architectures requires changing the defintions at the top of 
	  streamflow.h, and implementing the correct atomic operations in 
	  atomic.h and bitops.h.

gcc 3.3.4:
	- Streamflow does not compile with gcc 3.3.4; it causes an internal 
	  compiler error when full optimizations are turned on. It has been 
	  successfuly compiled with gcc 4.0.2 and gcc 3.4.5.

Machine dependent files:
	- atomic.h and bitops.h are taken from the Linux kernel source, 
	  with minor modifications.
