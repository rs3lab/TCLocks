Steps to run psearchy :

0. cd into the `vbench` directory
1. sudo ./mkmounts tmpfs-separate
2. open config.py and search for variable `cores`
2a. It is a list for the number of cores to run on
2b. Modify as per requirement
3. sudo ./config.py psearchy
4. This will save all the numbers in results/yyyymmdd-time/benchmark-psearchy
5. To generate the data run : sudo ./graph results/< ... >/benchmark-psearchy
6. This will generate the .dat file and .pdf in /tmp/gnuplotXXXXXX/...

NOTE : Everything is owned by root so if you want to take it out of the vm then chown to ubuntu

ALTERNATE : You can run a single core count config by using sudo ./config.py -d -c NUM psearchy

Steps to run gmake :

0. cd into the `vbench` directory

2. open config.py and search for variable `cores`
2a. It is a list for the number of cores to run on
2b. Modify as per requirement
3. sudo ./config.py gmake
4. This will save all the numbers in results/yyyymmdd-time/benchmark-gmake
5. To generate the data run : sudo ./graph results/< ... >/benchmark-gmake
6. This will generate the .dat file and .pdf in /tmp/gnuplotXXXXXX/...
